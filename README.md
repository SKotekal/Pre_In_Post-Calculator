# Pre_In_Post-Calculator
Accepts expression in prefix, infix, or postfix form and outputs expression in all three formats. Only supports four basic functions and exponentiation. Follows order of operations (including parentheses). Looking to implement unary operators (such as negative, trig, factorial, etc.)

Algorithm uses a tree structure with the operation as the parent and the two operands as the children. If there are nested operations with the use of parentheses, the nested operation will act as one of the child nodes. Once this tree is set up, the infix, prefix, and postfix expressions can be easily generated by traversing the tree with infix (Left Node, Root Node, Right Node), prefix (Root Node, Left Node, Right Node), and postfix(Left Node, Right Node, Root Node). This traversal uses recursion and builds the expression. It is important to note that the prefix and postfix expressions don't need parentheses at all, while the infix expression generated by this program will have extraneous parentheses. Getting rid of extraneous parentheses because of order of operations may be a future feature that will be added. 
Tree created with object taking a value (String) as root and node objects as left and right children.
